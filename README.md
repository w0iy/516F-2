Docs to accompany kit for Collins 516F-2 S-Line Power Supply

These are files with instructions, figures and photos of the installation of Service Bulletin 1 to the Collins 516F-2 Power Supply. 
This SB uses a PCB and updates the capacitors to modern smaller types available from multiple vendors (in slightly varying diameters 
and lengths). It also provides for solid state rectifiers, should you desire. There is also an update to the Bias circuit that slsightly
changes the R values to provide a better voltage range. 

If the solid state rectifiers are used, then the unused filament windings can be used to BUCK the primary, lowering the output voltages 
slightly. Since most line voltages are now near or above 120VAC, the output HV and LV DC will be higher. 

Assembly of the PCB is easy. Make sure the diodes are pointing in the proper direction and the caps are inserted with the proper
polarity. The mechanical installation is more of a challenge. You need to drill out a few rivets and loosen the transfmormer to reach under
and install screws. (Use a thin piece of cereal box to hold the screw in a slit). 

Download all the files and look through them. There are a few pics of completed installations which may help. While there are physical
instructions on installing the wiring to the PCB, it is BEST if you are familiar with the schematic and follow the schematic as you 
attach wires to the PCB.  REMEMBER to connect the Bleeder Resistors to the HV and LV DC.
