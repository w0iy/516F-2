Several folks have reported bad relays lately. I've looked through the emails and it 
appears many of these folks are using a VAriac to bring up the PS.

The relay spec indicates the engage and dropout voltages. This is hysteresis and will result in 
the relay engage/disengaging, which causes the contacts to flash and burn. 
DO NOT USE A VARIAC IN THIS MANNER!

If you are going to use a variac you MUST:
1. Open the relay COIL.  Lifti one of the coil leads to the PCB. TAPE the open wire end. 
2. Short/bypass the relay NO output. You can do this by temporarily soldering the PCB relay output (Common and NO) pads together. 

This removes the relay from the circuit and you can bring the PS up slowly with the variac.
Consult the schematic to understand how this isolates the relay.
